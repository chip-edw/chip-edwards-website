        <h2 id="work"> Work </h2>
        <p > I currently Manage IT Production Support for a medium sized Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 implementation of ~1100 AX users with interfaces to portals serving
           over 80,000 customers, 1500 service contractors, and 15,000 sales partners. 
           I also manage support for a smaller Dynamics 365 F&O implementation. 
        </p>
          
         <p>In a normal day I work with Managed Service Providers for Application and Infrastructure support; both on shore as well as off shore, to coordinate support for
            incidents, excalate issues and coordinate code deployments. 
            Part of my role is to also implement and manage IT controls and approve elevated access requests. Since my team also manages application access requests I manage
            and oversee the Service Requests for access and often need to assist in ensuring the proper approvals are acquired, as also occasionally providing the access.
