                        <p> I currently Manage IT Production Support for a medium-sized Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3
                            implementation of ~1100 AX users with interfaces to web portals serving
                            over 80,000 customers, 1500 service contractors, and 15,000 sales partners.
                            I also manage support for a smaller Dynamics 365 F&O implementation.
                        </p>

                        <p> On a normal day, I work with Managed Service Providers for Application and Infrastructure
                            support; both onshore as well as offshore, to coordinate support for
                            incidents, escalate issues, and coordinate code deployments.
                            Part of my role is to also implement and manage IT controls and approve elevated access
                            requests. Since my team also
                            manages application access requests I manage
                            and oversee the Service Requests for access and often need to assist in ensuring the proper
                            approvals are acquired, as also occasionally providing the access.
                            <br>
                            Team building is critical to everything I do as I rely on a geographically diverse team from
                            several different
                            countries to ensure that application and infrastructure support are operating at peak
                            efficiency.
                        </p>

                        <p> I draw daily upon my experiences gained from over 20 years IT experience that range from
                            startups to global It organizations.

                       <p> I have been recently wondering why I never knew what I wanted to be when I grew up. </p>

                        <p>
                            Even now in my 50's I still often wonder what I really want to be.  I do remember times where I thought I wanted to be a scientists, 
                            a chemist, an astronaut, a musician, and many other things. I just never had the burning desire to be one thing. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I was in the Navy back in the 80's, hoping to see more of the world and thinking that would help me find my calling. 
                            I figured I just had not been exposed to it yet.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Funny how things work out, I just stumbled upon a couple of videos on Youtube that spoke about the desire to learm many things and exploring 
                            different disciplines being the normal mode of learning for humans. It has only been recenty in our history that we have started to focus 
                            on single disciplines and thinking that specialization it the ticket to success.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            All the videos were basically about the same thing; Polymathy. Where one person has the ability to learn different fields and that that 
                            knowledge from the different fields and create an intersection between each fiels and use the knowledge from one field to furthur ideas 
                            in other fields.
                        </p>  
                        
                        <p>
                            All of the videos I saw on Polymathy basically said that is the normal state of learning for humans. Furthur they stated that you don't need 
                            to be an intellectual giant or a singuarly special person to benefit from this form of learning or even to benefit the world.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            In fact, I believe that is what a Technologist basically is. Someone who is able to cross over different technical disciplines and benefit their 
                            employeers or customers. While they may not have that deep knowledge of a specialist a Technologist makes up for it in many other ways.
                        </p>

                        I am thankful for those videos which gave me the reference and context to provide the following.

                        <p>
                            For those over 50 who still enjoy learning and being productive here are some of my key take aways from my 55 + years of learnings. 
                            Things you likely already know but take for granted or undervalue. As you think about your career strategy if you are over 50. 
                            If you are just starting out this is just as relevant to you and I hope you don't take as long as I did to understand the relevance.
                        </p>

                <p>Some Key thoughts from Terri Trespicio
                    - Passion is not a plan, it's a feeling. And feelings change. You can be passionate about a
                    person, or a job one day, and then not
                    passionate the next.
                    We know this and continue to use passion as a yardstick to judge everything by, instead of
                    seeing passion for what it really is: the fire that ignites when you start rubbing sticks
                    together.

                    - This idea that everything you're supposed to do should fit into a passion verticle is
                    unrealistic.

                    Success fuels passion more than passion fuels success. - Dilbert creator Scott Adams

                </p>

                <p> Ben Vandgrift -
                    Specialization is great for insects, but it is not the normal state for people.
                    Polymathy - A relatively small number of people have has a disporportunately large effect on our
                    world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Take away from Ben Vandgrift:

                

                    The most important skill as a technologist it to - Learn to learn new things!
                    From the directed learner who uses what they already know as a stepping stone to what the next
                    learning opportunity
                    to the opportunistic learner who learns by necessity to solve problems and every gradient between,
                    we need to keep on keeping on
                    learning new things.

                    It is not the smartest person that solves problems faster. It is the person who has more information
                    or knows where to find it.
                    It is the person who has more places from which to draw inspiration.
                    It is the person who has more practice learning.
                    To solve a problem when you are stuck, you need to come at it from multiple directions. If you can
                    do that then as an individual
                    you can problems that normally take teams of specialized people to solve.

                    Learn the skills not the academic disciplines. Forge the tools without limiting your thinking. Avoid
                    narrow mindsets and limited perspectives.
                    Solutions should not be confined to one discipline.
