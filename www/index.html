                        <p> I currently Manage IT Production Support for a medium-sized Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3
                            implementation of ~1100 AX users with interfaces to web portals serving
                            over 80,000 customers, 1500 service contractors, and 15,000 sales partners.
                            I also manage support for a smaller Dynamics 365 F&O implementation.
                        </p>

                        <p> On a normal day, I work with Managed Service Providers for Application and Infrastructure
                            support; both onshore as well as offshore, to coordinate support for
                            incidents, escalate issues, and coordinate code deployments.
                            Part of my role is to also implement and manage IT controls and approve elevated access
                            requests. Since my team also
                            manages application access requests I manage
                            and oversee the Service Requests for access and often need to assist in ensuring the proper
                            approvals are acquired, as also occasionally providing the access.
                            <br>
                            Team building is critical to everything I do as I rely on a geographically diverse team from
                            several different
                            countries to ensure that application and infrastructure support are operating at peak
                            efficiency.
                        </p>

                        <p> I draw daily upon my experiences gained from over 20 years IT experience that range from
                            startups to global It organizations.

                    <p class="text-center"> I have been recently wondering why I never knew what I wanted to be when I
                        grew up. </p>

                    <p>
                        Even now in my 50's I still often wonder what I really want to be.
                        <br> I do remember times where I thought I wanted to be a scientist,
                        a chemist, an astronaut, a musician, and many other things. I just never had the burning desire
                        to be one thing;
                        to dedicate my totality to one pursuit.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I was born in a small town in Virginia about 45 minutes South West of Norfolk, Va. Close to the
                        Naval Ship Yards.
                        <br>Anyone raised in a small town knows the small town mentality and likely understands why I just
                        wanted to getaway.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I joined the U.S. Navy back in the '80s, hoping to see more of the world and thinking that would
                        help me find my calling.
                        I figured I just had not been exposed to the right job yet. I thought if I was exposed to a wide
                        variety of career paths, that magical calling would just happen and I could go all in.
                        <br>
                        Since I had a background in electronics I ended up working on weapons control systems and guided
                        missile systems as my primary job in the Navy.
                    </p>

                    <p>While I was in the Navy I did a lot of different things. I was a helmsman on a hydrofoil, I did
                        drug interdiction as
                        part of a joint task force. In my spare time, I became a technical diver doing some decompression
                        dives.
                    </p>

                    <p>I had that desire and passion for exploring new things. Yet somehow I began to settle as I began
                        trying to advance my career.
                        I had the thought that you gotta focus on just one thing if you want to be successful.
                    </p>

                    <p> When I got out of the Navy and started a family I began to settle more.
                        My wife informed me I could no longer do deep dives as I had family responsibilities and the important
                        thing became providing for my family.</p>

                    <p>Now I am a bit further along in my career, my daughter has left the nest and during these chaotic
                        times we are in and where I am for the
                        most part working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, I find myself musing over the way
                        I used to be. Always excited to try new things and ready for the next adventure.</p>


                    <p>
                        Funny how things work out. I would not change a thing, yet I wonder what it would have been like
                        if I had the opportunity to do things differently.
                        <br>
                        I just stumbled upon a couple of videos on Youtube that spoke about the desire to learn many
                        things and exploring
                        different disciplines being the normal mode of learning for humans. It has only been recently in
                        humanities history that we have started to focus
                        on single disciplines and thinking that specialization it the ticket to success.

                        All the videos were basically about the same thing; Polymathy. Where one person has the ability
                        to learn different fields and that that
                        knowledge from the different fields and create an intersection between each field and use the
                        knowledge from one field to further ideas in other fields.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        All of the videos I saw on Polymathy basically said that is the normal state of learning for
                        humans. Further, they stated that you don't need
                        to be an intellectual giant or a singularly  special person to benefit from this form of learning
                        or even to benefit the world.

                        In fact, I believe that is what a Technologist fundamentally is. <br>
                        Someone who has the ability to cross over
                        different technical disciplines and benefit their
                        employers  or customers. <br>While they may not have that deep knowledge of a specialist a
                        Technologist makes up for it in many other ways.

                        I am thankful for those videos which gave me the reference and context to provide the following.
                    </p>

                        For those over 50 who still enjoy learning and being productive here are some of my key takeaways 
                        from my 55 + years of learning.
                        Things you likely already know but take for granted or undervalue.
                      
                    </p>

                    <p> As you think about your career strategy; whether you are over 50; or just beginning 
                        this is just as relevant to you. <br>
                        I hope you don't take as long
                        as I did to understand the relevance.</p>

                            <li> Dedication and curiosity are not mutually exclusive. You will reap maximum rewards when
                                you are dedicated to curiosity itself.
                                Stated another way: "If you want to go for the maximum and not just the minimum, be
                                driven by curiosity and not just by necessity" - Ben Vandgrift.</li>
                            <li> Learn the skills, not just the academic disciplines. Forge the new tools you need to do
                                the job yourself without limiting your thinking.
                                In this way, you can avoid the narrow mindsets and perspectives that plague so many
                                others as those
                                narrow mindsets are what keep us all from seeing what really matters.</li>
                            <li>It is not the smartest person who solves the problem fastest. it is the
                                person with the broadest experiences 
                                and the person who has the most practice learning that solves the really hard less
                                obvious problems.
                            </li>
                            <li>The most important skill for a technologist is to learn how to learn new things. I prefer to
                                learn a range of things that can help solve
                                many different types of problems rather than to simply just specialize so that I can
                                only solve specific types of problems. </li>
